# Phoenix String Decryptor
NTCore's Phoenix Protector offers a "string encryption" feature, which, as its name tells us, protects the strings present in your program.

Even after searching on the internet for ten minutes, I couldn't find a Phoenix string decryptor;<br>that's why I made one.

# How do I find a "method token" ?
Once you'll start this decryptor, it will ask you for a "method token": it's basically just the token of the decryption method. But how do you find it ? Here's a step-by-step guide :
<h2>1 - Open your file into DnSpy and find an encrypted string</h2>
